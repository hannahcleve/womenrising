## Women supporting women in tech and business.

Women Rising is a website that helps to promote women by assisting them in
finding female peers and mentors in their field. Visit our site here [Women Rising](http://www.womenrising.co/)

The website for Women Rising has become an open source project. Our goal in
making this open source is to give mainly women but anyone who is looking to
get into development or someone who is just looking for a project to help out
with, a place to display their awesome skills as well as try to give feedback
to people on their code. All this is to be done in a respectful way, any
contributor should review our code of conduct at
[Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/kma3a/womenrising/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
If you have any complaints please let us know by sending an email to
info@womenrising.co and we will do our best to address them!

## Getting Started
Check out our [Contributing doc](https://github.com/womenrising/womenrising/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing to this project. In order to get started please fork the repo and clone it to have it locally on your computer.

### Setup

1. Clone the repo and `cd` (change directory) into the newly created directory.

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:your-username/womenrising.git
  cd womenrising
  ```
2. Copy `config/application.example.yml` to `config/application.yml`.

  ```sh
  cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml
  ```

From here, there are two possible ways to continue. The easiest option is to use Docker to run the application in a container. The other option is to set up the Rails app traditionally. Consider which is best for you and then follow one of the sets of instructions below.

#### Option 1: Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed and the daemon running.

1. Copy or symlink `config/database.docker.yml` to `config/database.yml`.
  ```sh
  ln -s database.docker.yml config/database.yml
  ```

2. Build the necessary Docker images.

  ```sh
  docker-compose build
  ```

3. Create the database

  ```sh
  docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
  ```

4. Start the Rails and Postgres servers

  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

You should be able to see it running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Try `docker-compose run web rspec` to run the tests.

#### Option 2: Traditional

If you don't have Ruby installed, check out [Getting Started with Ruby](https://github.com/womenrising/womenrising/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED_WITH_RUBY.md)

1. Install the required gems.

  ```sh
  bundle install
  ```

2. Set up the database:

  Copy `config/database.local.yml` to `config/database.yml` and edit as necessary.

  Then create and seed the database with:

  ```sh
  bundle exec rake db:create
  bundle exec rake db:migrate
  bundle exec rake db:seed  # seed file containing test users
  ```

3.  Run the test suite to ensure everything is passing.

  ```sh
  bundle exec rspec spec/
  ```

4. Fire up the app, and open your web browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

  ```sh
  rails server
  ```

  Or you can run guard, which will automically start the server and rerun your specs when you make changes to files.

  ```sh
  bundle exec guard
  ```

### Importing the Staging or Production DB

```sh
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -d womenrising_development ./db/backup-2016-01-14.dump
```

### Monthly Matches

```sh
# open a heroku rails shell
heroku run rake womenrising:peer_group_monthly_match c -a womenrising
```

### Setting up with Linkedin(*optional*):

Create your own application on
[linkedin developer site](https://developer.linkedin.com/) on this page click
my Apps which will take you to a create an account screen. If you already have
a linkedin account look to the bottom to find a sign in with linkedin.

This personal application will allow you to create a testing enviroment which
will allow you to login as yourself and view changes to your profile.

##### Next create an application on Linkedin

Fill in the information with temporary info using your personal email and phone
for business. The application use will be networking and you can use the
womenrising logo and url for the logo and url and click submit after agreeing
to the terms.

Under Authentication, you will find your client ID and Secret (keep these
secret!!). You will also see Default Applications persissionsi under that
check off r\_basicprofile r\_emailaddress and w\_messages (you will need those
for the profile).

Next under OAuth 2.0 add in the redirect URL for
http://localhost:3000/users/auth/linkedin/callback and
https://localhost:3000/users/auth/linkedin/callback (this will allow linkedin
to redirect back to your localhost also if your localhost is something other
than 3000 you just need to change the number to the correct one).

##### Setting up With Oauth2.0

In your config folder create an application.yml file (this file should contain
the appid and secret key that you created).  Once you have done that go into
the file and add:

```yaml
LINKEDIN_ID: <<your Client ID here>>
LINKEDIN_SECRET: <<your Client Secret here>>

gmail_username: <<your gmail email address>>
gmail_password: <<your gmail password>>
```

*note this file is in the .gitignore file so it will not be uploaded to the
internet (hence why we are having you create the linkedin dev account). The use
of the gmail username and password is only for sending emails and will not be
seen by anyone else.*

This will give you access to Linkedin so that you will be able to sign-in.
