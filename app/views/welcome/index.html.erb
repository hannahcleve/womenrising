        <p> So, you got your matches for the month, you're meeting two new women and
          you want to make the most of it? The best way to network is to GIVE FIRST!
          Here's some tips:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Be open-minded.</strong> You never know before you meet someone who could be a great new friend or have a connection you need.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Start by asking questions.</strong> Get to know where these folks are at with their careers, where they want to go, and what roadblocks are in the way.
          </li>
          <li><strong>End the conversation with asking, "Is there a way I can help?"</strong> Often we're too shy to ask, but there are so many ways to help each other! Even simple introductions or tweeting about someone's project may aid them.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Be genuine.</strong> If it's not a fit to stay in touch and be friends, that's ok. Making peer connections is all about chemistry. You will meet more women next month and hopefully see each other around events!

        <h3 class='sectionHead'>Mentors</h3>
         <p> Thank you for volunteering your time to give back to those coming up behind you on the ladder! Here's some ways to make the most of it: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start by asking questions.</strong> It's important to understand where someone is in their career and where they want to go. Once you know that, it's just a matter of recognizing the roadblocks they face, and how to get past them.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Keep listening.</strong> Often your mentee has their own answer. Strongly affirm that answer when they find it. The conclusions they come to themselves stick better than anything you could say.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Be genuine.</strong> If it's not a fit after the first phone call, it's ok to move on and get a new mentee next month. This is about chemistry! Let them find someone who does believe in them to save both of you a lot of head and heart ache.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Set expectations.</strong> If you really believe in your mentee and want to keep in contact, agree on how you will communicate, when and what your goals are. This will help a great deal in paving the way to good mentor/mentee relationship.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="tips-info">
        <h3 class='sectionHead'>Mentees</h3>
        <p> If you received a mentor from our platform who is ready to answer your questions, please make the most of the experience! We have a shortage of women willing to give their time to this and we trust you to learn from it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Be proactive!</strong> It's on you to reach out to your mentor that month. Follow up quickly to schedule a call and do so politely.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Know your ask.</strong> The more you've thought about what you need and can ask specifically the more someone can help you. "I just want someone to mentor me overall" doesn't give them anyway to help.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Thank them for their time.</strong> In the first email, on the call, and in any follow-up. They're busy people!
          </li>
          <li><strong>Let them know if you're too busy.</strong> If you signed up on accident and can't complete your mentor match this month, say something! "Ghosting" is not appropriate here.
