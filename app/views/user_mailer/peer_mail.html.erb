    <h3>Get ready to schedule and meet with your new friends!</h3>

    <p>Welcome to your "Mini-meetup match" email! Remember, from here we leave it to you to get in touch with your two peer matches and find a time for a group coffee, lunch or a drink in your area.
      <strong>Find time to schedule in the next couple weeks so you don't forget!</strong>
    </p>

    <h4>Your mini-meetup for this month:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <% @peers.each do |peer| %>
      <li>
        <strong><%= peer.first_name %>
          <%= peer.last_name %></strong>
        <br><%= mail_to peer.email %>
        (Ask me about:
        <%= peer.top_3_interests.join(", ") %>)
        <% if peer.linkedin_url %><br><%= link_to 'Connect on LinkedIn', peer.linkedin_url %><% end %>
      </li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, this is about meeting new people so be open minded! You never know which of these women could become your new best friend or help you get your next job. Make our day by tweeting a picture or a story of your match at

    </p>
